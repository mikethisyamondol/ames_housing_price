# TL;DR

This project is based off the Ames IA Housing Price dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). As the name suggests, the idea is to predict housing prices based off different attributes such as square footage, quality/condition, location, etc.

The first part of this project which is found in the "Ames IA Housing Prices - EDA" notebook walks through general EDA, pre-processing, feature engineering, and feature selection. The data as received from Kaggle contains a lot of null values which needed to be cleaned up before any modeling takes place. Luckily, after closer inspection of the data dictionary (data_description.txt), it seems as though a lot of the null values corresponded to a house not containing a feature such as a basement, garage, or pool. After cleaning, a few features were created to reduce any potential multicollinearity, and a handful of features were highlited as potential predictors of housing price, based off correlation. TotalSF (TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF'), OverallQual, neighborhoodcat (Neighborhood categorized based on mean SalePrice), GarageCars, and TotalBaths (FullBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5*(HalfBath + BsmtHalfBath)) seem to be good indicators of price.
